So as I continue to try to sharpen my skills as a developer I am trying to learn a little more about computer science. I found a free course online that I'm finding to be really good. One of the things I learned this week was a little about sorting algorithms. The problem that you're trying to solve with an sorting algorithm is how to do it in the most efficient way possible that doesn't take too long. So there are a few options for how to sort and it seems like the best way generally is a merge sort the benefits of this is that even as the problem gets larger the time it takes doesn't go up so much unlike the other sorting algorithms.
