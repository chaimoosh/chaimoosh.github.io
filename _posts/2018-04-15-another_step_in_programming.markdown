The next step in my coding journey was continuing sinatra. While I was in middle of doing it I took off for a week. This was great to really get a break from the intensity of learning so much so quickly. What I learnt though as soon as I started again was that learning quickly sometimes means forgetting quickly too. So I had to really go back and review.
Now I'm up to sessions and log ins in Sinatra. These didn't seem hard when i started doing them but kept getting harder as I moved along. 
As it progressed it took some time to get the information that i needed to know and know where to apply it. Having the information is a step but knowing where to apply became the hard part. With this it took a bunch of long hard steps to get through it but thankfully it's working.
Now I'm up to using Active Record with sinatra. This is a challenge because each one of these is hard in it's own right and putting them together just makes it more complicated. The nice thing about it is that now I can see how what I'm learning can really help do things. The hardest part for me though is now that it's that much more complicated there's so much more room for mistakes. But this is really pushing me to get better and go back and review what I've learnt until now and make sure I really know it.
