After finishing the course I decided to go back to the basics and get a better understanding of them. I started with HTML just to really get the basics well. HTML is the language of all browsers everywhere so whenever you load a web page what you're seeing is HTML. HTML is a markup language and not a programming language it doesn't deal with any logic but just takes content and displays it. All pages have the same layout and you just change what's inside them. You start with an <HTML> tag and everything on the page goes in there. The first thing that goes in there is the <head> tag, in there you put all the data that doesn't get displayed but the page needs it to style or any logic you need. You put in there the name of the page that shows up on the tab of the browser and links to CSS stylesheets and Javascript. 
After that comes the <body> tag in there goes all the data that you want displayed on the page. You can put in there regular text, headers, tables, ordered lists, and unordered lists. You can also put in links to other pages either on your site or somewhere else on the internet and you can put in images as well.  This is how you get the skeleton of a web page which will show a a bunch of text with very minimal styling and on top of this you build the CSS to give it some style and Javscript to give it some brains.
