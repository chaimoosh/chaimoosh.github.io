React has many cool features that makes it easier to manage a web application. The basic idea is to split everything on your web page into components that way it's easier to manage and it's easier to debug. The way you do this is by making components. Components are little pieces of your web page and generally they are used multiple times. The way you pass data to components is by using props. Props are properties that are passed down from a parent component to a child component for the child component to do whatever it needs to do with them.
