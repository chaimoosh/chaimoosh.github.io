Javascript is a beautigul thing. I came from learning ruby and then built up to rails and really bringing in HTML and CSS to start javascript. The beauty of this is that I got to see some of the things I could do but javscript just made it that much more powerful. In taking a dead thing like the page of a browser and really livening it up.
It all starts with function which were a little confusing for me at first because coming from ruby it felt like it really wasn't clean. That took a little getting used to but slowly it started to click. Once I was comfortable with that I started to see the next pieces like jquery. With this you can do even more because not only can you run functions in your browser you can actually interact with the database.
All that really just led me straight into my project. Now I'm able to get and post things without the page refreshing. This was really cool and also not so difficult to integrate into my already funtioning rails project. I added some extra funtionality so users could see their appointments on their home page without moving to a different page and that the users could see the appointments they create on the page they create them.
