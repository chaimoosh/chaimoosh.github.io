This week I started a free online course in computer science. It's called CS90 and was given at Harvard as an ontro to computer science for people with no background in it. It starts out from the very basics of what you can do with code and they start by teaching some stuff in C. So seeing C for the first time I found it's syntax to be rather familiar because it is a really old language and a lit of the other coding languages were styled like it. For example Java and Javascript yntactically are similar so I can use the same for loops with exactly the same syntax as a Javascript for loop. It's also similar in the sense that it needs to be compiled but you don't need to install anything because it comes pre-installed on computers.
