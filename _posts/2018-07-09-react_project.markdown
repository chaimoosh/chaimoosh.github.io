So finally I've reached the final project of my course the React project. I took some time to think about what I can do with react to make something nice and functional and I settled on making a simple shopping list app. The first thing I did was to set up the back end. It took some time to research what the best way to do it was and I found some great resources on how to make a rails api to manage it.
The front end though was much more challenging. I felt like I knew the basics of react and redux but getting them to work together with each other and the api proved to be quite challenging. The great part was that I had to go back and really learn it well so it became really clear how everything in react works from receiving props to passing props and using the store and the reducers.
