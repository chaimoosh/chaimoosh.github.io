As I continue in my job search I keep getting exposed to new ways to put what I learned in the course to use. I found out about salesforce which is one of the biggest software companies in the world. They make a CRM platform which is a way for companies to keep track of sales and clients but it also does so much more than that. In salesforce everything really goes back to a database which becomes an object so this was just like object oriented programming in Ruby that I learned in the course. It also goes into a database which can be called with regular SQL queries. And then all these things that you make can be displayed on the front end with components which are similar to React components. All this is what comes out of what I learned in the course that makes it so much easier to understand all these concepts.
