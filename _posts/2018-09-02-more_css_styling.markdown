So as I continue in my job search one of the things I'm trying to do is add to my portfolio. One of the things that I found I was lacking was styling in most of my projects so I decided to build something that was more style with CSS and less back end stuff. I decided to try to build a website for my wife's business. I started by trying to use some bootstrap layout stuff I found that to be pretty useful. Than I remebered that while I was doing the course I saw in a video a great utility that there is on mac's to fid the hexadecimal color of anything on the screen of the computer. So I googled it and found that it's called Digital Color Meter and it's in the utilities folder so I was able to find some cool colors to use on the website.
