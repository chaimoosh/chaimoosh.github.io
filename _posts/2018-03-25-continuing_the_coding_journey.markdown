So continuing from my last post where i wrote about my cli project it was really great to get that done and see what i could do. The next step was learning active record. What was fascinating about that was that i was able to see how by just working with this I could do everything I had learnt without having to code it myself. 
The next step in the course was learning HTML. This is totally different then what i had been doing with ruby because ruby is all logic and methods but HTML just sets things up on the page without any logic but just styling and you just tell it where to put what. So when i first started coding I learnt HTML and i found it fascinating but now it lost its luster becuase after getting ruby to do things it just wasn't the same. It felt so tedious to just style something and not provide logic. Thankfully I was able to get through this. 
The next step was learning css which can do some pretty cool stuff. But it was still so tedious to do it  because even though what it does is cool it's very similar to HTML in the sense that it doesn't use logic and it just does what you tell it to do. Now this was even harder for me becuase I'm not that good at things like this that you nedd to keep trying and testing to see if it works the way I want it to. But thankfully i got through this and I was able to move on to the next part.
