One of the things I have been focusing on since I graduated from the program is trying to get better at Javascript. The way I'm doing that is by trying to learn the language itself better and by trying to learn some frameworks. I started to look for something to build a backend in Javascript with in Node and I settled on trying to learn Express. I started looking around for a tutorial and finally found one that was very basic and didn't have too much overhead. I started following along with it and I began to realize how similar it was to other frameworks I had previously learned like Rails and Sinatra that instead of using Ruby to define the routes and controllers for the application you use some Javascript functions and you use the same RESTful routes that I used in other places. Other than that it was pretty much just some regular Javascript that I was already comfortable with so it really was similar to what I had learned before.
