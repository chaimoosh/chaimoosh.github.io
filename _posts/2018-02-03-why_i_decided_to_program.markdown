Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by technology. Now, as an adult, I wanted to see if I could turn that passion into a career. When the time came to join the workforce, I tried to become an IT technician. I wanted to see if I could take this enjoyment of technology and do something with it.

I started by apprenticing by a local IT technician and doing small work for him. I outgrew that job pretty quickly, so I found a job in an office where, besides for sitting at my desk doing paperwork, I managed all the low level IT issues. But this job was only a seasonal job, so after the summer I needed to find something new.

I then transferred to another department; my job was to help people sign up for programs. I needed to speak with them and decide which programs they were eligible for based on their income and family size. I enjoyed the work and was doing a good job, but I knew this wasn't for me. I decided to look around to see if there was anything that would call to me.

Around this time I saw an ad in a magazine about an informational session on technology bootcamps. I went to the seminar, and found out that there are schools that can teach coding in 3 months and get you started on a new career immediately after. One of the things they told me about was the free trials that some schools have to start learning to code;  I started using it right away. As soon as I started the program, I knew that it was for me. I found it so exciting to know how to make programs work and I love to really "get under the hood" and figure out all the ins and outs. Since then I haven't looked back. I'm really enjoying all the time and energy it takes to really get good at it. I hope to continue on and get a job in this amazing field.
