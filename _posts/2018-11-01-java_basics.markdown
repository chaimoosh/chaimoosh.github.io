As I continue looking for a job I am trying to also gain new skills to build on the one's that I learned already. I decided that learning Java would be a way to up my skills and make myself more marketable. The rules of Java are similar to those of Ruby in the sense that it's also an object oriented programming language so you're basically dealing with the same stuff. The differences though stand out right away though. First of all Java needs to be compiled and while I'm still not sure what exactly that means at a deep level I do know that it means I can't use the familiar text editors I was working with until now like atom and move to eclipse which is a Java IDE. Another difference that struck me is that rather than just declaring variables like you would in Ruby in Java you need to say what the variable is going to contain for example if you want a variable that will have an integer when declaring that variable you have to say that it will hold an integer.
