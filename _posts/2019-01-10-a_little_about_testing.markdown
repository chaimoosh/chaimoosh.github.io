One of the things I learned in the web development course was to use Test Driven Development. The idea of TDD is to write the tests before you start working because by doing that you have to really put down what exactly you want your code to do and then you write your code to get the tests to pass. The other form of testing is called Behavior Driven Development that is that you decide what you want you just code it and then if you want you write some tests to make sure it's working properly. Either way you go about it writing good tests is a necessary part of programming because without it you can never know if your program will work the way you want it.
